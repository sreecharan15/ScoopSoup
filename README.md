# ScoopSoup
 The function of the system is to detect fake news and guide users on the relevance of the news. The system is a tool for users where they can search different trending news, forwarded messages through social media or any other platform and check the authenticity of the news and decide whether or not the searched topic is fake or factual.           When user finds a news on any of the social media platforms, the user would copy the text of news and use it as an Input or query for our system. Based on the document collection we have, we will retrieve all the relevant documents and indicate how much authenticity is present in the news.  


# Motivation to Study and Potential Benefits
 
Nowadays, believing in the forwarded news on social platforms can lead to misunderstandings. We see a lot of fake news in recent times and many people believe that and face issues. This has been a problem in the past and also in the recent times. Such news is intentionally circulated to either highly praise something or defame it. In both the cases, our system would help the user to find the authenticity of the news and make proper conclusions. We need such tool to know what is actually going on in the world and take our decisions according to it. Everyone who uses social media can use this tool and benefit from it.
 
# Prior Work
 
 Shu, Sliva, Wang, Tang, & Liu (2017) suggest a fake news detection system where news is characterized into social and traditional and later the same news is checked against fake news detection approaches and a model is created of the same to detect the newsâ€™s authenticity.
 
# Usefulness
 
The system that we are suggesting will focus on news that is available through social media and will help user in finding the authenticity of the news once our system characterizes the same and puts it into our defined characterized buckets. Also, we will be recommending the user the relevant news that is from verified sources. In recent times most of the content consumed by user is through online media specially smartphones as it's free and easily accessible hence there are higher chances of users consuming news that is not verified and the same becomes truth for individuals. This could be avoided by using such a system where a user always has a system he could validate the news and be aware of the actual truth.
 

# Plan & Dataset
 
 Text classification model such as Vector Space Model and using a modified version of KNN classification in this project to compare news and check for reliability.Have divided the training set into 80% for training and 20 for testing.
Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and the link for the same is given below.
